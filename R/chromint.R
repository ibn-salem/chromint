#'chromint: A package to analyse chromatin interactions.
#'
#'This package provides functions to analyse genome-wide chromatin intraction
#'data, like Hi-C. There are functions to parse high-resolution Hi-C data from
#'Rao et al. 2014, Cell to quantify intreaction frequencies between pairs of
#'genomic regions (like genes and enhancers) and randomizations to compute
#'enrichment of interactions.
