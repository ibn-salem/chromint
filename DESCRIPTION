Description: This package provides functions to analyse genome-wide chromatin
    intraction data, like Hi-C. There are functions to parse high-resolution Hi-
    C data from Rao et al. 2014, Cell to quantify intreaction frequencies between
    pairs of genomic regions (like genes and enhancers) and randomizations to
    compute enrichment of interactions.
